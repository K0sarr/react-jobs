## Overview
The React Jobs Website is a comprehensive and interactive web application designed to help users find and manage React developer job listings. Built with React, Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS, this project provides a dynamic and responsive user experience. Users can create new job listings, browse through existing ones, update details, and delete jobs as needed. This application demonstrates the full potential of React, showcasing various features such as components, props, state management, and data fetching using a local JSON server.

## Technologies Used
+ React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable components and efficient state management.
+ Vite: A modern frontend tooling system that offers faster build times and optimized production bundles.
+ Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly designing and customizing responsive user interfaces.
+ JSON Server: A full fake REST API for prototyping and testing, used here as a local backend to simulate API requests.
+ React Router: For managing navigation and routing within the application.
+ React Toastify: For displaying toast notifications to improve user experience.
+ ***Note: The project uses a local JSON file as a mock backend, which means it currently cannot be deployed with its backend functionality. The data is served and manipulated locally, making it ideal for development and testing purposes.***

## Features
+ Create Job Listings: Users can add new job listings via a form.
+ Browse Job Listings: View a list of all job listings with details.
+ Update Job Listings: Edit existing job listings.
+ Delete Job Listings: Remove job listings from the list.
+ Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices.
